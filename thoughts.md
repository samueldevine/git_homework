Takeaways from my first 2 classes of Mod 0:

 - Being organized is the key to success! This applies on many levels, including but not limited to taking good notes, managing your time outside of class, and writing good git commit messages!

 - Helping others with problem solving and/or troubleshooting is a great way to check your own understanding of the material that is being covered.
