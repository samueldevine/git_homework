Takeaways from my first 2 classes of Mod 0:

  - Being organized is the key to success! This applies on many levels, including but not limited to taking good notes, managing your time outside of class, and writing good git commit messages!

  - Helping others with problem solving and/or troubleshooting is a great way to check your own understanding of the material that is being covered.

Strategies that I'm committed to trying during the rest of Mod 0:

  - I'd like to do my best to finish homework and/or Mod 1 prework as early as possible! This will allow for extra time to ask for help if needed, or help answer questions that others may encounter and fortify my own understanding!

  - I am committed to taking great notes for the rest of Mod 0 and refining my strategy to make sure it's effective and ready for Mod 1 to begin.

Shoutout:

  - Shoutout to Ellen C. for taking some time to meet up with me after Session 2 to help troubleshoot an error message I was seeing in my terminal!

  - Shoutout to Mallory V. for being a patient driver-navigator partner despite hiccups with zoom permissions and terminal errors!

  - Shoutout to Billy F. for being a great study partner to work on the Mod 1 prework with!

New thoughts:

  - I wonder what I will have for dinner...
